what is printl( scope.userid )?

update the map to work with the new files names | hammer is currently not opening (thanks valve)

I want to change from CamelCase to snake_case in my scripts.

## Scripts
```
üì¶vscripts
 ‚î£ üìúmain.nut
 ‚î£ üìúglobals.nut
 ‚î£ üìúvs_eventlistener.nut
 ‚î£ üìúvs_events.nut
 ‚îó üìúvs_library.nut
 ```

### main.nut

Called from hammer with a Script Node?

Entry point which handles most of the logic.

#### Callbacks

- round_start
  - If it's round 0 the help menu is printed
  - Bots will be kicked each round if they're not enabled.
  - Iterate over every player and give them their weapons.
  - A new player class will be created if their id hasn't been assigned to one.

- player_say
  - Parses the players input and executes the corresponding commands

### globals.nut

Holds the state of the players while the server is running.

This is possible due to some hack using the `rope magic`. Whatever that means.

### vs_eventlistener | vs_events | vs_library

Used for listening to in-game events.
The library can be found at [samisalreadytaken/vs_library](https://github.com/samisalreadytaken/vs_library).

I may be using an old version of this library so things may be different.
